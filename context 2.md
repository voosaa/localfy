### 1. Project Breakdown

**App Name:** localfy
**Platform:** Web  
Core Concept:
Users suggest creative date ideas (e.g., "sunset picnic in the park," "street food tour," or "DIY cocktail workshop"). They are then matched with others who like the same ideas. The app combines dating with activity planning, making it easier to break the ice and creating more fun dates.

How It Works:
1. Profile Setup:
Snelle registratie - with social media accounts like facebook, instagram
Users fill in basic info (name, age, location).

They select their interests from a list (e.g., adventure, art, food, sports, gaming, etc.).

They upload a few photos and write a short bio.

2. Propose Date Ideas:
Users can submit their own date ideas (e.g., "museum bingo" or "kayaking at sunset").

They describe the activity, choose a category (e.g., "adventure," "romantic," "budget-friendly"), and indicate if itâ€™s indoors/outdoors.

Optional: They can suggest a location or time.

3. Matchmaking Based on Date Ideas:
The app shows date ideas from other users nearby.
ðŸ‘‰ Swipe right on activities that spark your interest
ðŸ‘ˆ Swipe left to skip (no hard feelings!)
Users can "like" date ideas that interest them.

If two people "like" the same idea, theyâ€™re matched!

Merges the best of Meetup + Tinder"

4. Plan Your Date:
After a match, a chat opens where they can discuss date details (e.g., time, location).

The app suggests locations, reservations, or even discounts with local partners (e.g., a restaurant or activity provider).

5. Post-Date Feedback:
After the date, both users can discreetly indicate if they want a follow-up date.

They can also provide feedback on the date experience (anonymously), which helps improve matchmaking.
